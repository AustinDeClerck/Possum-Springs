# Possum-Springs

Open index.html to see the site.

This was one of my personal projects to research and practice with Parallax and Skrollr.

The websites visuals were based off of the town in the video game, Night in the Woods. In accordance with that design, the website mainly explains how the town of Possum Springs originated and how the story starts with the main character.
